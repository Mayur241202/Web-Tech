    <!-- <p>: The most commonly used element for text content -->
    <!-- Important Note: Paragraphs are block-level elements that automatically add space before and after the text -->
    <!-- Interview Insight: <p> is crucial for readable and well-structured text in HTML documents -->
    <p>This is a basic paragraph demonstrating the use of the paragraph tag in HTML.</p>

    <!-- Using the class attribute to apply CSS styles to a paragraph -->
    <!-- Question to expect: How does the class attribute help in styling? -->
    <!-- Answer: It allows for the application of CSS styles to specific elements, enhancing design flexibility -->
    <p class="intro">This paragraph has a class called "intro" applied to it, making it blue with a larger font size.
    </p>

    <!-- Styling with inline CSS using the style attribute -->
    <!-- Note: Inline styles have the highest specificity but are less maintainable compared to external CSS -->
    <!-- Interview Point: Inline styles should be used sparingly to keep HTML clean and maintainable -->
    <p style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">This paragraph is styled using inline CSS, making it green and bold.</p>

    <!-- The <p> tag can contain other inline elements like <a>, <span>, <b>, etc. -->
    <!-- Question: Can block-level elements be placed inside <p> tags? 
         Answer: No, block-level elements should not be nested inside <p> as it disrupts the flow of the document -->
    <p>This is a <span class="highlight">highlighted</span> text within a paragraph using the span tag.</p>

    <!-- Demonstrating text alignment with CSS -->
    <!-- Note: Text alignment can be controlled using CSS properties such as text-align -->
    <p class="center">This paragraph is centered using the "center" class.</p>

    <!-- <p> tags can also be used for accessibility and screen reader support -->
    <!-- Interview Insight: Properly structured paragraphs improve the readability and flow of content -->
    <p>This paragraph is standard, demonstrating accessibility and proper structuring of content.</p>

    <!-- Nested <p> tags are not allowed, but multiple <p> tags can be used sequentially for separating text -->
    <!-- Common Mistake: Avoid nesting <p> tags inside other block elements like <ul>, <div> unless correctly structured -->
    <p>Paragraph 1: The correct way to separate text is by using multiple p tags.</p>
    <p>Paragraph 2: Each p tag creates a distinct block of text content.</p>
