    <!-- <hr>: The horizontal rule tag is used to create a thematic break or separation in the content -->
    <!-- Important Note: By default, it creates a simple line to visually separate sections -->
    <!-- Interview Tip: Often used to denote a change of topic or to separate different sections of content -->
    <h1>Section 1</h1>
    <p>This is some content in the first section. The horizontal line below separates this section from the next.</p>

    <!-- Example of a basic horizontal line using the <hr> tag -->
    <!-- Question to expect: How can you style an <hr> tag? 
         Answer: It can be styled using CSS properties like height, color, margin, etc. -->
    <hr>

    <h1>Section 2</h1>
    <p>This section is separated from the previous one using an hr tag.</p>

    <!-- Styling an <hr> with CSS -->
    <!-- Note: Using CSS, you can control the thickness, color, and other visual aspects of the line -->
    <hr class="styled-hr">


    <!-- <br>: The line break tag is used to break the line and continue the content on the next line -->
    <!-- Important Note: <br> is an inline element and doesn't add extra space like block-level elements -->
    <!-- Interview Insight: Commonly used in places where a new line is required without starting a new block of text -->
    <p>This is a sentence with a line break<br>right in the middle.</p>


    <!-- Using multiple <br> tags to add extra space between lines -->
    <!-- Interview Tip: Overuse of <br> tags can make HTML less readable; consider CSS for managing spacing -->
    <p>This is another line.<br><br>Notice the double line break used to create extra space between lines.</p>

    <!-- Common Misuse: Avoid using <br> for adding large spaces; it's best for single line breaks only -->
    <!-- Question: When should <br> be avoided? 
         Answer: Use it sparingly; for larger spacing, CSS margin or padding is preferred. -->
