    <!-- <h1>: The most important heading, used for the main title of the document -->
    <!-- Interview Note: Only one <h1> should be used per page for SEO best practices -->
    <!-- Common Question: How does <h1> affect SEO? 
         Answer: It signals the main topic of the page to search engines and should be unique -->
    <h1>Main Heading - H1</h1>

    <!-- <h2>: Used for major sections under the main heading -->
    <!-- Important: h2 can be used multiple times; it helps structure the document into clear sections -->
    <!-- Interview Tip: Often asked how to properly structure headings in an article or webpage -->
    <h2>Subheading - H2</h2>

    <!-- <h3>: Subheadings under <h2>, used for further content division -->
    <!-- Note: Proper nesting of headings helps screen readers and improves accessibility -->
    <!-- Interview Question: What happens if heading levels are skipped (e.g., <h2> to <h4>)? 
         Answer: Skipping disrupts the document flow and affects accessibility and SEO. -->
    <h3>Sub-subheading - H3</h3>

    <!-- <h4>: Used for deeper levels of content under <h3> -->
    <!-- Important Note: h4 is great for structuring complex content, like detailed articles -->
    <!-- Usage Tip: h4 is often used for subsections, lists, or detailed breakdowns of content -->
    <h4>Subsection - H4</h4>

    <!-- <h5>: For minor sections, often used less frequently compared to h1-h4 -->
    <!-- Note: Not commonly used, but important for maintaining semantic structure -->
    <!-- Common Question: Are h5 and h6 necessary? 
         Answer: Yes, for maintaining a detailed structure, especially in technical documents. -->
    <h5>Minor Subsection - H5</h5>

    <!-- <h6>: The least important heading, typically used for minor notes or labels -->
    <!-- Important: Helps complete the heading hierarchy, even for small sections -->
    <!-- Interview Insight: Demonstrates understanding of full HTML structure when used correctly -->
    <h6>Footnote or Label - H6</h6>
